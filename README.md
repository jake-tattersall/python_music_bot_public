# python_music_bot_public

This bot is a proof-of-concept bot and was my main method of learning how to code. 
As a result, some parts of the code may seem beginner-like or unoptomized or unprofessional.
However, it has since been updated in a few parts after gaining more programming knowledge.

This bot will play songs with a queue format. 
Songs can be added to the queue using the same format to play songs.
Shuffle and loop properties are available.
Playlists can also be added to the queue, but require the exact URL.
The bot also features some miscellaneous commands.
